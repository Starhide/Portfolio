Part of the senior sequence at Western Oregon University involved learning all of ASP.net MVC. That meant learning Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Bootstrap, and many other concepts. So, they constructed a set of assignments for us to complete our first term of senior project. Part of the assignments was to make a webpage for each explaining and showing each of the assignments. Below is my list of assignments each with a general topic the assignment was meant to teach. 

1. [Assignment 1](hw1): Git, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
2. [Assignment 2](hw2): JavaScript, JQuery
3. [Assignment 3](hw3): C#
